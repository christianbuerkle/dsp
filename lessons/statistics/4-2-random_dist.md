[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> 
t = np.random.random(1000)

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')

The PMF does not shows that some numbers appeared more frequently in our random sample, but the CDF indicates that it is a uniform distribution because the cumulative probability increases approximately linearly.
